# A very low-effort directory cache

Designed to be simple to use and understand, 
not particularly effective.

## Performance

Bad.

## Performance pt. 2

Okay if you write lazily to disk.

## Should be used when

You have some toy-project that's pinging an external 
API and you want to easily just cache responses to certain requests
to reduce load on your counterparts servers.
